# Stay On Task
A Chrome extension to help with my ADHD by letting me know if I'm on an off task site, but without closing the tab, which would make me more upset and distracting me more if there's something unsaved in an off-task tab that gets closed.

I don't really have a good name for it yet so I just called it 'Stay On Task'
