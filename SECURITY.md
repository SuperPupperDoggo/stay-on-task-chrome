# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Latest version only. Chrome usually automatically updates extensions, so older versions shouldn't be a problem.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities on the issues tab, and tag it appropriately. It will be handled when I get around to it. They are, however, taken very seriously. Please be as descriptive as possible, and if you can, please provide steps to reproduce the problem.
